This project is a practical lesson in The Odin Project curriculum where Iâ€™m going to build a basic recipe website 

As a result of this lesson, I'll learn:
- The basic structure of any HTML document
- How to link to other pages of your project using the `<a>` tag and relative paths
- How to create ordered and unordered lists
